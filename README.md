Simplified and easy-to-understand ToDoList application.  
Create a project and write a list of things to do!  

There are three lists, whose roles you may decide. We recommend that you write what you have not yet done on the left side, what you are currently doing in the middle,   and what you have finished on the right side.  

The exe file can be found here  
C:\Users\macar\source\repos\todolist\bin\Release  
Do not touch inside the ListDete in the same file!  
The mechanism inside the file is in the order 01234
